                <p>Here are some of my favorite restaurants, one located back at my hometown in the island of
                    Tinian, a place where I grew up and it's wonderful homey cuisines and another favorite located where

                    only

                        cuisine, and sometimes a mixture of them both! They offer lunch and dinner sets every day on
                        their Facebook page. Their meal sets include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Soup of the day <em>or</em> Miso soup</li>
                        <li>Rice</li>

                    <p>One of my favorites when visiting the restaurant is the view it offers. The interior decor of the
                        restaurant provides a laid&ndash;back allure of the view of the ocean. One of the best parts is
                        the almost 360&deg; wide windows that surround the restaurant, characterized by light, and the
                        wooden texture that provide you with that island fine dining feeling.</p>
