            <p>Here are some of my favorite restaurants, one located back at my hometown in the island of
                Tinian, a place where I grew up and it's wonderful homey cuisines and another favorite located where I

                find here in the CNMI.</p>

                    <p>Dolphin restaurant has a variety of meals to offer such as their delicous pork cutlet, which
                        comes in a
                        set which includes:</p>

                    <p>One of my favorites when visiting the restaurant is the view it offers. Because it is located at
                        the top
                        of the hotel, you almost get a 360&deg; view of the entire area which highlights one of the main
                        streets
                        in Garapan, as well as the big beautiful ocean.</p>
